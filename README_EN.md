# LongBench: A Multilingual, Multitask Benchmark Tailored for Long Context Understanding

**LongBench** is the first comprehensive dataset for multi-language, multi-task, and comprehensive assessment of **long text understanding** capabilities of large language models. In the context of the widespread attention to the multi-language capabilities of large models, LongBench includes different languages (Chinese and English) to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the large models' multi-language capabilities in long texts. In addition, LongBench consists of twenty different tasks, covering key long-text application scenarios such as single-document QA, multi-document QA, summaries, few-shot learning, code completion, and synthesis tasks.

We are fully aware of the potentially high costs involved in the model evaluation process, especially in the context of long-text scenarios (such as manual annotation costs or API call costs). Therefore, we have adopted a fully automated evaluation method, aimed at measuring and evaluating the model's ability to understand long texts at the lowest cost and most effectively.

LongBench includes 13 English tasks, 5 Chinese tasks, and 2 code tasks, with the average length of most tasks ranging from 5k to 15k. From the main task categories, LongBench includes six types of tasks, namely multi-document QA, single-document QA, summaries, Few-shot learning, synthetic tasks, and code completion. For detailed statistics and construction methods of LongBench tasks, please refer [here](task_en.md).

| Task Type | \#English Task | \#Chinese Task | \#Code Task |

| Multi-document QA | 3 | 1 | - |
| Single-document QA | 3 | 1 | - |
| Summarization | 2 | 1 | - |
| Few-shot learning | 3 | 1 | - |
| Synthetic Tasks | 2 | 1 | - |
| Code Completion | - | - | 2 |

#### Radar Chart of Long Text Task Capability

#### Variation of Abilities under Different Text Lengths
To more specifically analyze the model's relative performance under different text lengths, the following chart shows the average relative scores on all tasks over different text length intervals.
![](misc/curve.png)

> Note: Assume that the model scores x on the data within a specific length range of a task, and y on all data of that task, then the model's **relative score** for that length range is (x/y-1). To better compare the trends of different models, we shift all the lines to 0 from 0-4k.

## How to evaluate models on LongBench

#### Loading Data
You can download and load the **LongBench** data through the Hugging Face datasets ([ðŸ¤— HF Repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/THUDM/LongBench)):
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

datasets = ["hotpotqa", "2wikimqa", "musique", "dureader", "narrativeqa", "qasper", "multifieldqa_en", \
    "multifieldqa_zh", "gov_report", "qmsum", "vcsum", "trec", "nq", "triviaqa", "lsht", "passage_count", \
    "passage_retrieval_en", "passage_retrieval_zh", "lcc", "repobench-p"]

for dataset in datasets:
    data = load_dataset('THUDM/LongBench', dataset, split='test')
```
Alternatively, you can download the folder from [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/THUDM/LongBench/resolve/main/data.zip) to load the data.

#### Data Format

All data in **LongBench** are standardized to the following format:

```json
{
    "input": "The input/command for the task, usually short, such as questions in QA, queries in Few-shot tasks, etc.",
    "context": "The long context text required for the task, such as documents, cross-file code, few-shot samples in Few-shot tasks",
    "answers": "List composed of all standard answers",
    "length": "Total length of the first three items of text (counted in characters for Chinese and words for English)",
    "dataset": "The name of the dataset to which this piece of data belongs",
    "language": "The language of this piece of data",
    "all_classes": "All categories in classification tasks, null for non-classification tasks",
    "_id": "Random id for each piece of data"
}
```

#### Evaluation
We provide an evaluation code using ChatGLM2-6B as an example. Firstly, run the [pred.py](pred.py) under the repository:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python pred.py
```
You can get the model outputs on all datasets in the `pred/` folder. After that, run the evaluation code of [eval.py](eval.py):
```bash
python eval.py
```
You can get the evaluation results on various datasets in `result.json`. Please note that we provide the input format suitable for each dataset and the maximum output length limit we summarized in `config/`. You can modify them during the evaluation to better suit the model you want to evaluate. After modification, when evaluating with [pred.py](pred.py), the data will be automatically organized according to the new format to get the corresponding model output.

## Evaluation Result on Each Dataset

The following tables display the Zero-shot evaluation results (%) of the model on all subtask datasets, where Chinese datasets are denoted by "zh" (please refer to this [link](task_en.md) for the evaluation metrics used for each task).
